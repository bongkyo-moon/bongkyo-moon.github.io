				<b>IP QoS in wireless mobile environments</b><br /><br />
				<ul>
					<li>RSVP Extensions for Real-time Services under IP Mobility</li>
					<li>DiffServ Extensions for QoS Provisioning under IP Mobility</li> 
				</ul>
				<p>
					<u>Overview:</u><br />
					RSVP model, which is efficient resource reservation in the fixed endpoints, becomes invalid under host mobility. Hence, we investigate the problems of standard RSVP in providing real-time services in wireless mobile networks. We also identify the advantages and drawbacks of the existing RSVP proposals to support QoS under both micromobility and macromobility.<br />
					In addition, we focus on DiffServ for QoS provisioning in RANs. We then investigate the problems of DiffServ under IP mobility environments. We investigate a mobility-aware drop precedence scheme for flows experiencing handover events.

					<li>MMPP (Markov-modulated Poisson process)</li>
					<li>Mobility Behaviour modelling</li>
					<li>IEEE802.16e and WiBro</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<u>Overview:</u><br />
					For guaranteed services, the routing for real-time flow and resource reservation mechanisms must be used together since the required bandwidth must be reserved when a connection is established. An analytic model for real-time flow connections in a wireless Mobile Internet (IEEE802.16e or Wibro) is developed, and performance measures are drived.

				<b>Radio Resource Scheduling Scheme in Wireless Mobile Internet</b><br /><br />
				<p>
					<u>Overview:</u><br />
					Wireless networks generally provide radio access bearer services to support layer 2 connection between a user terminal and a base station. In the wireless mobile Internet, voice or multimedia traffic flow request may allow access routers to exercise admission control over wireless link and traffic control at the IP level. Thus, efficient radio resource sharing mechanism is required in order to react to rapidly changing traffic conditions due to host mobility.

				<b>Seamless Switching of RSVP Branch Path for Soft Handover in All-IP Wireless Networks</b><br /><br />
				<p>
					<u>Overview:</u><br />
					This research addresses the QoS issue of a RSVP flow during handoff events. For the QoS guarantee of real-time applications with RSVP reservation in All-IP wireless networks, mechanisms are required to minimize the resource reservation path changes and packet loss resulting from handoff events..
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Reliable RSVP PATH Reservation for Multimedia Communications Under an IP Micro-mobility Scenario</b><br /><br />
				<p>
					<u>Overview:</u><br />
					We focus on how (quality of service) guarantees can be provided for RSVP flows during handoff events in an IP micromobility network. For this purpose, RSVP message delays and signaling overheads should be minimized, and handoff service disruption should also be minimized. By rerouting the RSVP branch path at a crossover router at every handoff event, and establishing the new RSVP path between the CR and new BS in advance while the existing reservation path is maintained, ongoing RSVP flows can be kept with the guaranteed QoS.
